Whats happenin? I hope you are well and safe.

Alright so I made everything work, will post a guide on reddit or here really soon.

For now, I will provide with USB EFI(EFI folder for boot & install) folder and Post-Install EFI (EFI folder for when you have successfully installed macOS) folder.

Enjoy!
