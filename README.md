# Dell-Inspiron-15-7580-i7-8565U-Intel-UHD-620-Hackintosh

Hey guys. Here's the EFI folder for Catalina Hackintosh for Dell Inspiron 15 7580 i7 8565U Intel UHD 620.

Some of the things not work. I will be working on them and updating the EFI here accordingly.

So far, this EFI boots you to the system, graphic acceleration works, audio/mic works with internal speakers/mic but headphone jack does't work. Which can be fixed with a proper layout ID. Trackpad works but the tap clicks don't work. While the single and double finger scrolling works perfect and hard clicks work as well but single hard click works weird. 

The things I will be working on:
1. Brightness controls
2. Trackpad fix
3. Headphone jack fix

I have not tested the HDMI input/output, so not sure about that. I may be writing a full guide here after being successful with a perfect hackintosh laptop. Wish me luck.
